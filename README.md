## **Project Overview**  
Médico Inteligente is a tool designed to optimize the efficiency of doctors during consultations. Its primary objective is to reduce the time doctors spend on administrative tasks such as taking notes or searching for information, enabling them to focus more on providing direct patient care.

The platform offers several key features to streamline medical workflows:
- **Voice Notes**: Doctors can record voice notes during consultations, which are automatically transcribed into text.  
- **Consultation Recording & Transcription**: The tool allows full consultation recordings with automatic transcription for future reference.  
- **Patient Reports**: These transcriptions and notes are used to generate comprehensive reports, which integrate seamlessly into the patient's clinical history.

## **Purpose**  
The goal of this project is to develop a modern, scalable, and user-friendly frontend that enhances the interaction between doctors and the platform. This interface is designed to be:  
- **Intuitive**: Easy to navigate with minimal learning curve.  
- **Fast**: Performance-optimized to handle key tasks quickly.  
- **Accessible**: Compliant with accessibility standards, ensuring all medical professionals can efficiently use the tool.

With this project, we aim to significantly improve the user experience by simplifying operations and processes involved in medical consultations.
